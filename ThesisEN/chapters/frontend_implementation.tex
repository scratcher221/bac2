\chapter{Frontend Implementation with Vue.js}
\section{Redesigning the Frontend}
The frontend for the cryptocurrency sportsbetting app was originally programmed in the AngularJS framework. In order to improve the user experience and response times, the Vue.js framework will be used to rebuild the front end that the user interacts with. The reason for this is that some elements of the original implementation would download unnecessary libraries and components that were not essential for the functionality. By redesigning the frontend these unnecessary components can now be left out, to improve performance.
